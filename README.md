My videos about gitpod are at

You can run this github repository as a Gitpod by clicking

https://gitpod.io/#github.com/hpssjellis/ionic-webcam-help

Which inserts gitpod.io/# into the URL 

This Gitpod should install Java, Android sdk, Cordova, Qrcode and Ionic and setup paths.

The bash files can be run with ./ infront of them Don't forget "tab" autofills


To create and run a basic cordova file 

./a01-cordova-create.sh    


Change the www/index.html file and then rebuild the project

./a02-cordova-rebuild.sh

To install more android sdk platforms 

./a03-android-sdkmanager.sh



I am new to Ionic so this might take a while to get correct. Presently the following bash command generates a debug.apk, but it does not install on my phone.

./a04-ionic-start.sh
